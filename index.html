    The importance of time management is in its ability to assign meaning to time, letting people make the most of their time. In a business context, it is used to set goals and expectations for companies and their employees. Good time management skills help employees deliver quality work and meet their goals effectively. 
    Time management also helps managers to understand what employees are capable of and to set realistic goals.
    Poor time management skills cause employees to miss goals and deliver poor work,
     become overly stressed out and anxious, and run short of time. When time is used inefficiently, it has deleterious effects on employees, management and the company.
    Time poverty is a result of poor or nonexistent time management.
     People find themselves in this state when they have too much to do and too little time to do it. 
     Their personal lives suffer, and they feel increasingly overwhelmed with responsibilities and activities despite working hard.Time management requires active decisions about what a person wants to do. Without time management, individuals continually react to external stimuli and lose a sense of control over their work and lives.
    All work takes time, but some tasks are more valuable than others. 
    Reallocating time to higher-value work improves both productivity and work-life balance. 
    Good time management creates a healthier workplace overall.
    Benefits of time management
The benefits of effective time management apply equally to the business and its employees. 
Some of these benefits include the following:

Happier employees. When employees have enough time to get their work done, they are happier and less prone to burnout.
Improved creativity. When not stressed by time issues, employees have the space and energy to be more creative in their work. They can actively engage with their work instead of passively reacting to it. This increases innovation.
Lower absenteeism. Stressed and burned-out employees take more sick and other time off.
Lower turnover. With a better work experience, employees are likely to stay at a job and not look elsewhere.
Increased productivity. 
Employees who are less likely to be absent and who enjoy their work are more productive.
Enhanced reputation. Businesses that encourage effective time management are known as good places to work, improving employee recruitment and retention
